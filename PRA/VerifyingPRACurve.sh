# An expansion of VerifyingPRA.sh that also uses a small awk script to linear regression fit the runtimes to a square root curve.
# Gives you the R^2 value (where = 1.0 is perfectly matched and = 0.0 is utterly useless).  
# On my laptop, R^2 value is typically between 0.95 and 0.99, but the randomness of Pollard-Rho means that the final test can sometimes finish very quickly, ending in 0.2 seconds rather than the expected 3-9 seconds, which gave an R^2 score of 0.5031.  So it is recommended to run the Verifying Curve script again if you get a low R^2 score just to be sure.
